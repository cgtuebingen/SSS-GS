# About
We propose photorealistic real-time relighting and novel view synthesis of subsurface scattering objects. We learn to reconstruct the shape and translucent appearance of an object within the Gaussian Splatting framework. TODO

# Code
Paper is currently under review, we will realse the code and dataset shortly (~ end of october 24) in a cleaned version. Up until then if you have any questions regarding the project or need material to compare against fast, feel free to contact us.
